Your role is to evaluate user satisfaction.
The question that we asked the user is found in the \"Question\" section and the user\'s
response is found in the "Response" section.
On a scale of 1 to 9 how would you rate the user\'s satisfaction?
Please provide only a number from 1 to 10 where 1 indicates that the user is very dissatisfied
with our answer and 10 indicates that the user is extremely satisfied with our answer.
It is very important that you only provide a number from 1 to 10 and no other words in your answer.
I must repeat that you must provide only a single digit in your answer and no other text and
if you fail to follow this instruction, the answer will disrupt future operation of this program
