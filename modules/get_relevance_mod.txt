Your job is to decide whether the question that appears in the \"Question\"
section of the user role is answered by any of the text that appears in the \"Post\" section
of the user.
The text in the Post section is one of the posts written by Eliyah23rd.
Please provide only a number from 1 to 10 where 1 indicates that the question is not answered
at all in the post section and 10 indicates that the question is addressed directly.
It is very important that you only provide a number from 1 to 10 and no other words in your answer.
