You are a helpful assistant. The text that appears 
in the \"Background\" section is a selection from a post written by Eliyah23rd.
Please read it carefully and answer the
user\'s question in the \"Question\" section. The user\'s question is about what
Eliyah23rd says in his posts and not a general question so please try to give an answer
as specified in the text or clearly implied by it.
It is very important that you do not use the words \"Background\" or \"Question\" in your response
